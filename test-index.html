                        <p><b>Abstract: </b>Fault-tolerant error correction (FTEC), a procedure which suppresses error propagation in a quantum circuit, is one of the most important components for building large-scale quantum computers. One major technique often used in recent works is the flag technique, which uses a few ancillas to detect faults that can lead to errors of high weight and is applicable to various fault-tolerant schemes. In this talk, I will further improve the flag technique by introducing the use of error weight parities in error correction. The new technique is based on the fact that for some families of codes, errors of different weights are logically equivalent if they correspond to the same syndrome and the same error weight parity, and need not be distinguished from one another. I will also give a brief summary of my works on FTEC protocols for several families of codes, including cyclic CSS codes, concatenated Steane code, and capped color codes, which requires only a few ancillas.</p>

                        <p><b>Abstract: </b>Fermionic Linear Optics (FLO) is a restricted model of quantum computation which in its original form is known to be efficiently classically simulable. We show that, when initialized with suitable input states, FLO circuits can be used to demonstrate quantum computational advantage with strong hardness guarantees. Based on this, we propose a quantum advantage scheme which is a fermionic analogue of Boson Sampling: Fermion Sampling with magic input states. </p>
                        
                        <p>We consider in parallel two classes of circuits: particle-number conserving (passive) FLO and active FLO that preserves only fermionic parity and is closely related to Matchgate circuits introduced by Valiant. Mathematically, these classes of circuits can be understood as fermionic representations of the Lie groups U(d) and SO(2d). This observation allows us to prove our main technical results. We first show anticoncentration for probabilities in random FLO circuits of both kind. Moreover, we prove robust average-case hardness of computation of probabilities. To achieve this, we adapt the worst-to-average-case reduction based on Cayley transform, introduced recently by Movassagh, to representations of low-dimensional Lie groups. Taken together, these findings provide hardness guarantees comparable to the paradigm of Random Circuit Sampling.</p>
                        
                        <p>Importantly, our scheme has also a potential for experimental realization. Both passive and active FLO circuits are relevant for quantum chemistry and many-body physics and have been already implemented in proof-of-principle experiments with superconducting qubit architectures. Preparation of the desired quantum input states can be obtained by a simple quantum circuit acting independently on disjoint blocks of four qubits and using 3 entangling gates per block. We also argue that due to the structured nature of FLO circuits, they can be efficiently certified.</p>

                        <p><b>Abstract: </b>In quantum theory, whenever we make a measurement, the outcomes will be random samples, distributed according to a distribution that is determined by the Born rule. On a high level, this probability distribution arises via high-dimensional interference of paths in quantum state space. Often, this 'sign problem' is made responsible for the hardness of classical simulations on the one hand, and the power of quantum computers on the other hand. In my talk, I will provide different perspectives and results on the sign problem and ponder the question inhowfar it might serve as a delineator between quantum and classical computing. In the first part of the talk, I will motivate the emergence of the sign problem from a physics perspective, and briefly discuss how a hardness argument for sampling from the output of generic quantum computations exploits the sign problem. In the second part of the talk, I will take on a computational-physics perspective. Within the framework of Monte Carlo simulations of complex quantum systems, I will discuss the question: Can we mitigate or *ease* the sign problem computationally by finding a perhaps more suitable basis in which to describe a given system? Specifically, I will discuss various measures of the sign problem, how they are related, and how to optimize them -- practically and in principle. </p>

                        <p><b>Abstract: </b>Recently, works such as the landmark \(\text{MIP*=RE}\) paper by Ji et. al. have established deep connections between computability theory and the power of nonlocal games with entangled provers. Many of these works start by establishing compression procedures for nonlocal games, which exponentially reduce the verifier's computational task during a game. These compression procedures are then used to construct reductions from uncomputable languages to nonlocal games, by a technique known as iterated compression. </p>
                        <p>In this talk, I will introduce and contrast various versions of the compression procedure and discuss their use cases. In particular, I will demonstrate how each can be used to construct reductions from various languages in the first two levels of the arithmetical hierarchy to complexity classes defined using entangled nonlocal games. Time permitting, I will also go through a high-level overview of some ingredients involved in performing compression.</p>

There has been extensive previous work on efficient quantum algorithms for linear differential equations. However, analogous progress for nonlinear differential equations has been severely limited due to the linearity of quantum mechanics. We give the first quantum algorithm for dissipative nonlinear differential equations that is efficient provided the dissipation is sufficiently strong relative to the nonlinearity and the inhomogeneity. We also establish a lower bound showing that differential equations with sufficiently weak dissipation have worst-case complexity exponential in time, giving an almost tight classification of the quantum complexity of simulating nonlinear dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential applications of this approach to problems arising in biology as well as in fluid and plasma dynamics.</p>

                        <p><b>Abstract: </b>In many natural situations where the input consists of n quantum systems, each associated with a state space \(\mathbb{C}^d\), we are interested in problems that are symmetric under the permutation of the n systems as well as the application of the same unitary U to all n systems. Under these circumstances, the optimal algorithm often involves a basis transformation, known as (quantum) Schur transform, which simultaneously block-diagonalizes the said actions of the permutation and the unitary groups.  I will illustrate how Schur-Weyl duality can be used to identify optimal quantum algorithm for quantum majority vote and, more generally, compute symmetric Boolean functions on quantum data.  This is based on joint work "Quantum majority and other Boolean functions with quantum inputs" with H. Buhrman, N. Linden, A. Montanaro, and M. Ozols.</p>
